# Geometric-Operations-and-Other-Mathematical-Tools
 you will apply geometric transformations to an image. This allows you to perform different operations like reshape translation i.e. to shift, reshape and rotate the image. In the second part of the lab, you will learn how to apply some basic array and matrix operations to the image.        Geometric Operations Scaling Translation Rotation
